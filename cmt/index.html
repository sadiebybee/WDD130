      Second message-
      <br />
      I was diagnosed with Charcot Marie-Tooth Disease and I am writing this
      page to help people become more aware of CMT. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,
      also known as C.M.T, is the most common rare disease. C.M.T affects
      millions of people worldwide, however, not many people know about C.M.T or
      what it is, making it a rare disease.
