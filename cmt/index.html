        I was diagnosed with Charcot Marie-Tooth Disease and I am writing this
        page to help people become more aware of C.M.T. also known as
        Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. C.M.T. affects millions of people
        worldwide, however, not many people know about C.M.T. or what it is,
        making it a rare disease.
