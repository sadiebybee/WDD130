      <h1>How C.M.T. has affected my life</h1>
      <h3>
        When I was about 15 years old I was diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease. This disease affects everyone differently. For me, it affects
        my lower body, especially my feet and ankles. My hands and arms are
        affected a little bit but most of the muscle weakness, pain, and other
        symptoms are found in my feet and ankles.
      </h3>

      <p>
        I found it difficult to learn how to live with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease. I especially found it difficult once I got to high school. This
        disease makes my muscles super weak and so it is super easy for me to
        trip and fall. Because of this, I wasn’t really able to do things that
        people my age should be able to do. I began to feel frustrated,
        depressed, and sad. What really helped me during this time was building
        my relationship with my family members. I was able to find a lot of
        comfort and support from my family as they loved me and helped me when I
        had hard days. My mother has MS and also struggles with similar symptoms
        as I do. We are able to support each other as we know what it is like to
        not be able to walk really well and to be in pain. I am so grateful for
        my family, they were able to help me focus on the good and to see the
        blessings that I have been given.

        During this time I also focused on growing my relationship with Heavenly
        Father and Jesus Christ. Doing things such as going to church, reading
        the scriptures, and praying helped me to see God’s hand in my life. I
        was able to recognize my blessings and to recognize the love that
        Heavenly Father has for me. As I worked on growing my relationship with
        Heavenly Father I began to see miracles in my life. One miracle I
        received was that I was able to have surgery to help me walk better.
        After years of working with doctors and trying different things to help,
        I was told that I would be able to have surgery. They lengthened my
        Achilles tendon to help me walk better. I am now able to walk better
        than I was before. I am not perfect, I still trip and fall, I still find
        it hard to walk, and I still have days when I am in a lot of pain but I
        am so grateful for the blessings that I do have. My experience with
        Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has helped me to see my blessings and to
        understand the love that Heavenly Father has for me.
